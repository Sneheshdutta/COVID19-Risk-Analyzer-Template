# COVID19-Risk-Analyzer-Template
### Idea :

- The user will give some inputs against our predefined questions
- Then we will predict the chances of getting effected by COVID19, using our own derived algorithm.
- We will also include a tracker for active cases of COVID19.
- We will provide the live tracker of current hotspot and reports regarding COVID19.
